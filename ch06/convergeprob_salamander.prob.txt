Poisson model(1) or JTT model(2):

Input two branches for the test:
The first branch is from interior node to node The second branch is from interior node to node # of observed parallel-chage sites on these branches: # of observed convergent-chage sites on these branches: 
Expected number of parallel-change sites = 1.000000
Observed number of parallel-change sites = 2
probability= 0.300000

Expected number of convergent-change sites = 4.100000
Observed number of convergent-change sites = 5
probability= 6.600000
